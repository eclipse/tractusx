# Template Manifest for cluster issuers using the letsencrypt provider.
# We aim to have prod (no suffix) and staging ("-staging" suffix) issuers depending on the requirements for the authority. This is steered by the $CLUSTER_ISSUER environment variable.
# We aim to have service (no suffix) and portal ("-portal" suffix) issuers for the different ingresses/network layers. This is steered by the $ISSUER_VARIANT environment variable.
# Use envsubst before applying with kubectl
